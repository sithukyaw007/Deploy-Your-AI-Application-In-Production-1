# Deploy Your AI Application In Production

Stand up a complete, production-ready AI application environment in Azure with a single command. This solution accelerator provisions Microsoft Foundry, Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI Search, and connects to your tenant level Microsoft Purview (when resourceId is provided) —all pre-wired with private networking, managed identities, and governance controls—so you can move from proof-of-concept to production in hours instead of weeks.

### Use This Accelerator When

This accelerator is a good fit if you want an end to end AI and Data platform built from the AI Landing Zone, in one deployment:

1. Microsoft Foundry
2. Azure AI Search and OneLake index
3. Microsoft Fabric workspace and lakehouses
4. Optional Microsoft Purview integration
5. Private networking and production-style Azure controls

If you only want a small Foundry demo or a basic RAG sample, this repo is heavier than you need.

### Required Deployment Steps

1. Start from an environment with `azd`, `az`, and `pwsh` available
2. Authenticate with Azure and select the target subscription and region
3. Initialize git submodules if you are not using Codespaces or Dev Containers
4. Review `infra/main.bicepparam` and decide whether Fabric and Purview are enabled for the first run
5. Check Azure OpenAI quota in the target region
6. Run `azd up`
7. Validate the deployment in [docs/post_deployment_steps.md](./docs/post_deployment_steps.md)

For the first attempt, the lowest-risk path is to keep Fabric and Purview disabled unless you already have their prerequisites in place.

> **Important:** The checked-in values in `infra/main.bicepparam` are an opinionated end-to-end provisioning path for this accelerator, not a neutral baseline for every scenario. They are useful for demonstrating the full stack and the automation flow, but they might enable services, networking, mirroring behavior, or governance hooks that you do not want in your target deployment.
>
> Before running `azd up`, review the active settings across:
> - repo wrapper parameters in `infra/main.bicepparam`
> - AI Landing Zone feature flags and topology implied by the preprovision deployment
> - postprovision automation expectations in `azure.yaml`
> - supporting server-specific settings such as PostgreSQL networking, mirroring mode, and Fabric/Purview inputs
>
> Treat the current defaults as the repo's "golden path" for a broad end-to-end demo and validation flow. Adjust them deliberately if you want a smaller, cheaper, or less integrated deployment.

> **Security note (PostgreSQL mirroring):** The mirroring prep script must run from a VNet-connected host when Key Vault and PostgreSQL are private. If you need a non-VNet demo, temporarily open access to both Key Vault and PostgreSQL, run the script, then lock them down. See [docs/post_deployment_steps.md](./docs/post_deployment_steps.md) for the manual steps, including the temporary Key Vault override.

### Dependency Map

| Area | Required to enable it | If missing |
|------|------------------------|------------|
| Base deployment | Azure subscription permissions, `az`, `azd`, `pwsh`, Azure sign-in, initialized submodules, Azure OpenAI quota | `azd up` fails before or during provisioning |
| Fabric automation | Fabric Administrator permissions or an existing Fabric setup, plus valid Fabric parameter values | Postprovision Fabric steps fail |
| Fabric capacity creation | At least one valid `fabricCapacityAdmins` entry when `fabricCapacityPreset='create'` | Capacity creation fails |
| Purview integration | Existing Purview account resource ID in the target tenant and subscription | Purview steps fail |
| PostgreSQL mirroring | PostgreSQL enabled in the deployment with `postgreSqlNetworkIsolation = false`, then follow the post-deploy mirror steps | Database deploys, but mirroring is not completed |
| Private networking | `networkIsolation = true` and enough deployment time for private endpoint provisioning | Deployment takes longer and is harder to troubleshoot if other prerequisites are not already stable |

> **Purview note:** If you enable Purview integration, the identity running `azd` must have **Purview Collection Admin** (or equivalent) on the target collection. To ensure a collection is created or resolved, set `purviewCollectionName` so automation captures `PURVIEW_COLLECTION_ID` and the scan can be assigned.

### Choose Your Starting Path

| Goal | Recommended path |
|------|------------------|
| Fastest realistic validation | Local `azd up` workflow |
| Clean environment with fewer local setup issues | GitHub Codespaces |
| Deep customization before deploy | Read [docs/parameter_guide.md](./docs/parameter_guide.md) first |
| Lowest-risk first run | Disable Fabric and Purview, then re-enable later |

<br/>

> **Important: This repository uses git submodules**
> <br/>Clone with submodules included:
> ```bash
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/Deploy-Your-AI-Application-In-Production.git
> ```
> If you already cloned without submodules, run:
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```
> **GitHub Codespaces and Dev Containers handle this automatically.**

> **Shell requirement**
> <br/>The repo uses `azd` as the main deployment interface. The preprovision and postprovision hooks run with PowerShell (`pwsh`), so your environment must be able to invoke `pwsh`.

> **Important: Check Azure OpenAI quota availability**
> <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow the [quota check instructions guide](./docs/quota_check.md) before deploying.

### First Deployment Checklist

1. Run `azd auth login` and confirm the target subscription with `az account show`
2. Create a new environment and set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `AZURE_LOCATION`
3. Review `infra/main.bicepparam`, especially `principalId`, `aiSearchAdditionalAccessObjectIds`, `fabricCapacityPreset`, `fabricWorkspacePreset`, `fabricCapacityAdmins`, `purviewAccountResourceId`, `purviewCollectionName`, `networkIsolation`, `postgreSqlNetworkIsolation`, and `postgreSqlAllowAzureServices`
4. Run `azd up`
5. Follow [docs/post_deployment_steps.md](./docs/post_deployment_steps.md) to verify the deployment

> **Note:** Mirroring automation in the current branch is set for PostgreSQL deployments where `postgreSqlNetworkIsolation = false`. If you want PostgreSQL fully isolated, keep the private networking path and plan on the Fabric VNet gateway route for end-to-end mirroring.

### What You Get

After deployment, you'll have a complete, enterprise-ready platform that unifies AI development, data management, and governance:

| Layer | What's Deployed | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **AI Platform** | Microsoft Foundry with OpenAI models, playground, and prompt flow | Build, test, and publish AI chat applications without managing infrastructure |
| **Data Foundation** | Microsoft Fabric with bronze/silver/gold lakehouses and OneLake indexing | Store documents at scale and automatically feed them into your AI workflows |
| **Operational Data Mirroring** | Azure Database for PostgreSQL prepared for Fabric mirroring | Bring PostgreSQL operational data into Fabric with an automated connection-and-mirror flow plus documented fallback steps |
| **Search & Retrieval** | Azure AI Search with vector and semantic search | Enable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for grounded, accurate AI responses |
| **Governance** | Microsoft Purview with cataloging, scans, and DSPM | Track data lineage, enforce policies, and maintain compliance visibility |
| **Security** | Private endpoints, managed identities, RBAC, network isolation | Zero public internet exposure—all traffic stays on the Microsoft backbone |

<br/>

### Sample Workflow

1. **Deploy infrastructure** → Run `azd up` to provision all resources (~45 minutes)
2. **Upload documents** → Add PDFs to the Fabric bronze lakehouse
3. **Index content** → OneLake indexer automatically populates AI Search
4. **Test in playground** → Connect Foundry to the search index and chat with your data
5. **Publish application** → Deploy the chat experience to end users
6. **Monitor governance** → Review data lineage and security posture in Purview

### PostgreSQL Post-Provision Steps

If you deploy Azure Database for PostgreSQL, use these docs after deployment:

1. [docs/postgresql_mirroring.md](./docs/postgresql_mirroring.md)
2. [docs/post_deployment_steps.md](./docs/post_deployment_steps.md)

If the post-provision mirroring automation cannot complete, start with the **Minimal Manual Fallback** section in [docs/postgresql_mirroring.md](./docs/postgresql_mirroring.md). It calls out the shortest path for both public-access and private-network deployments.
